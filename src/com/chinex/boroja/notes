-----------WHAT is an Array?-------------
An Array is a collection of items. The items could be integers, strings, DVDs, games, booksâ€”anything really.
The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations. Because they're stored together, checking through
the entire collection of items is straightforward.

The two most primitive Array operations are writing elements into them, and reading elements from them.
All other Array operations are built on top of these two primitive operations.


------------Array Capacity and Array Length-------

The number of DVDs the box could hold, if it was full, or
The number of DVDs currently in the box.
Both answers are correct, and both have very different meanings! It's important to understand the difference between them,
and use them correctly. We call the first one the capacity of the Array, and the second one the length of the Array.

------------- Basic Array Operations -----------
we'll be looking at the three basic operations that are supported by almost every data structure;
--Insertion,
--Deletion,
--Search
